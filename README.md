# Minim-DMI
 
### [This is an old, archived project. It was once available on the iOS app store, but it has not been recently maintained or updated.]

Minim is a digital synthesizer. It synthesizes all sounds, allows for microtonality, and uses 3D touch and motion for gestural shaping of the sounds. A performer can also layer sounds for looped playback.

The appstore pics are below, and the appstore video can be found in the media folder.
